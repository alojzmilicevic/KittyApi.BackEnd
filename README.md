# 🐱 CatCam Server 🐱
Welcome to the heart of CatCam, the ultimate solution for keeping an eye on your beloved feline friends while you're away! Our powerful .NET Core 6 backend uses WebRTC and SignalR technology to stream live footage of your cats straight to your device.

💻 With support for multiple users and devices, our server can handle all of your cat-watching needs. And with our modern, reliable architecture, you can trust that your cats are in good hands (or paws).

🐈 But don't forget about the [client-side](https://github.com/alojzmilicevic/KittyApi.GUI)! Our sleek React app, powered by Material UI, vite and redux, makes it easy for you to connect and start streaming.
